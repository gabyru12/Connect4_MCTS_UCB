Implemented:
    - mcts search from root -> mcts search from actual game state
    - mcts node tree doesn't reset for each turn -> mcts node tree resets after each turn 

To implement:
    - draws don't count as losses -> draws count as wins, don't count at all, count them as half a win (0.5)
    - connect4 matrix is a list -> connect4 matrix is a numpy array (6,7)
