Tie Consideration: As you mentioned, test different ways of handling ties during backpropagation:
    - Count ties as half a win (0.5).
    - Count ties as losses (0).
    - Count ties as wins (1).
    - Ignore ties (donâ€™t update the node at all).
    - Observe how these changes affect move selection and win rates.

Exploration vs. Exploitation
    - Different UCB1 Constants: The exploration constant CC in UCT (Upper Confidence Bound) affects the balance between exploration and exploitation. Test different values (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5) to see how aggressive exploration impacts gameplay.
    - Adaptive Exploration: Adjust CC dynamically based on game progress. For example, explore more in the early game and exploit more in the late game.

Batch Simulations: Run multiple simulations in parallel and compare performance.

Compare starting over each mcts_tree once updating a state VS keeping the old values for each node (how much does it affect the computers memory) 

MCTS vs. Itself with Different Settings: 
    - Run matches where different MCTS configurations play against each other.
    - How impactful is being the first to play
    - Choose the settings of the mcts_control_unit_for_testing

Compare best_moves for mcts at 1k iterations vs 10k iterations with non-parametric tests wilcoxon and determine which is better
